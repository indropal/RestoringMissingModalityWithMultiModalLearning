<h3>Restoring Missing Modality With MultiModal Learning</h3>

<hr style="border: 4px double grey"></hr>

This project explores Multi-modal learning to obtain higher quality represenations for modailities especially for instances when they occur together at the same time.

Recent progress in Generative Deep Learning have given rise to state-of-the=art algorithms like Variational Autoencoder (VAE), GANs and their variations. This project makes use of a Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) that uses generative processes to learn joint distributions of multi-modal input and handle instances of missing data.
This project takes inspiration from the following research article - <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05335.pdf">"Multimodal Generative Models for Scalable Weakly-Supervised Learning"</a></em>.
